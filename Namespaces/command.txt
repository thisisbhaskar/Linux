unshare
=======

"unshare" can be used to create process in a new namespace.
unshare -<ns-identity-char> program args

To persist the created namespace even after program exits, use below "--<ns-name>" option. 
unshare --<ns-name>=<file-system-path> program args

This <file-system-path> can then be used by "nsenter" to execute procs in this namespace.

Persistent namespaces:
======================

By default, namespaces created with 'unshare' are deleted as soon as the process exits. To persist the namespace, use bind mount as below.
mount --bind /proc/<pid>/ns/<ns-name> <file-system-file>

Later, this mount point can be used by nsenter to execute processes in that namespace using below command:

nsenter --<ns-name>=<mounted-file-system-file> program args

To delete this namespace, use "umount <mounted-file-system-file>"

nsenter
