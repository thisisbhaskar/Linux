ip netns
========
Along with other standard ways of creating network namspace (clone, unshare), presistent network namespaces can be created with "ip netns"
"ip netns" can be used to create/delete persistent network namespaces.
Name spaces created with "ip netns" are stored in /var/run/netns

To execute a program in the created network namespace, use 'ip netns exec <ns-name> cmd'
"nsenter" can also be used to execute processes in these namespaces with "nsenter --net=</var/run/netns/<name>> program args
