Virtual Bridge is just like physical bridge, but simulated inside Linux kernel space.
Another interesting thing is that by creating v-bridge, a virtual is cable is connected form bridge to the host machine.
We can assign IP address to this host cable on the host machine side.

Each v-bridge can have a number of virtual cables attached to it.
Traffic coming on any of these virtual cables will be forwared to the other ports just like physical bridge.

We can create virtual eather network cables where one end is virtually connected to the bridge and other end is connected to the either host machine or to a different namespace.
This facilitates inter namespace communications.

brctl is used to create, maintain virtual ethernet bridge in linux.

brctl addbr <brname>
brctl delbr <brname>
brctl show <brname>
brctl show <brname>
brctl addif <brname> <ifname>
brctl dellif <brname> <ifname>
