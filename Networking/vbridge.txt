brctl
=====
brctl is used to create, maintain virtual ethernet bridge in linux.
Each bridge has a number of ports attached to it. Traffic coming on any of these ports will be forwared to the other ports.

brctl addbr
brctl delbr
brctl show
brctl show <brname>
brctl addif <brname> <ifname>
brctl dellif <brname> <ifname>

The cook thing about these bridges is that other end of the virtual eather net cable can be in different namespaces. This facilitates inter namespace communications.
