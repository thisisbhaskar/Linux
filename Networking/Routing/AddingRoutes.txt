Adding route for local network
===============================

For all the devices on the same network, we don't need a gateway. The local system can find destination IP address MAC usign ARP and 
release eathernet packets on the network via a particlar network interface.

ip route add <destination-network/address> dev <interface-name>
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0

This route basically means that any device on the 192.168.1.0/24 network can be reached directly without the need of a gateway.
Device first finds the MAC address of the destination address by using ARP protocol and then prepares eathernet frame encapsulating 
IP packet inside it and then releases the frame on the <interface-name>

Adding route for a different network
====================================

If the device needs to talk to a network which is not local, then the packets first needs to be sent to gateway.
Gateway will then device what is the next hop based on the destination address in the IP packet.

ip route add <destination-network/address> via <gateway> dev <interface-name>

This syntax shows that to reach a device on the <destination-network>, the eathernet packets needs to be sent to <gateway>. 
And it says that eathernet packets needs to be sent on the local <interface-name>.

The device will first finds the MAC address of <gateway> using ARP protocol and then encapsulates the IP packet in the 
eathernet packet, and releases on to the <interface-name>

Adding default route
